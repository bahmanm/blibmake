# bmakelib  [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/bahmanm/bmakelib.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/bahmanm/bmakelib) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache_License_v2.0-blue) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-NONE-green)

The minimalist Make standard library you'd always wished for!

bmakelib is essentially a collection of useful targets, recipes and variables you can use to augment
your Makefiles.

The aim is *not* to simplify writing Makefiles but rather help you write *cleaner* and *easier to read
and maintain* Makefiles.

## An Example

Makefile:

```Makefile
include bmakelib/bmakelib.mk

my-target : bmakelib.error-if-blank( VAR1 )
my-target :
	@echo ‚úÖ VAR1 value is $(VAR1)
```

Shell:

```text
$ make my-target
*** Provide value for 'VAR1'.  Stop.

$ make VAR1=foo my-target
‚úÖ VAR1 value is foo
```

# 2. How To Install

## 2.1 Prerequisites

Although not an installation dependency, bmakelib relies on **Gnu Make 4.4+** which was released
back in 2022.

To check the version which is currently installed, simply `make -v` in a terminal.  The output should
look like below.

```
$ make -v
GNU Make 4.4.1
...
```

üí° Installing Gnu Make is quite easy.  In fact as easy as:

```
$ wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-4.4.1.tar.gz
$ tar xzf make-4.4.1.tar.gz
$ cd make-4.4.1
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make install
```

## 2.2 Installing bmakelib

### RPM-based Linux Distro

Simply grab the prepackaged RPM from the [release page](https://github.com/bahmanm/bmakelib/releases/latest)
and install it using your faourite method.  For example:

```text
$ wget https://github.com/bahmanm/bmakelib/releases/download/v0.6.0/bmakelib-0.6.0-1.1.noarch.rpm
$ rpm -i bmakelib-0.6.0-1.1.noarch.rpm
```

### DEB-based Linux Distro

Simply grab the prepackaged DEB from the [release page](https://github.com/bahmanm/bmakelib/releases/latest)
and install it using your faourite method.  For example:

```text
$ wget https://github.com/bahmanm/bmakelib/releases/download/v0.6.0/bmakelib_0.6.0-1_all.deb
$ dpkg -i bmakelib_0.6.0-1_all.deb
```

### Homebrew (MacOS and Linux)

Assuming you have Homebrew configured, simply install bmakelib as below:
```
$ brew update
$ brew tap bahmanm/bmakelib
$ brew install bmakelib
```

### Installing From Source

Grab the source archive from the [release page](https://github.com/bahmanm/bmakelib/releases/latest):

```
$ wget https://github.com/bahmanm/bmakelib/releases/download/v0.6.0/bmakelib-0.6.0.tar.gz
$ tar zxf bmakelib-0.6.0.tar.gz
$ cd bmakelib-0.6.0
$ sudo PREFIX=/usr/local make install 
```

# 3. How To Use

bmakelib tries to introduce as little clutter as possible to Makefiles and be easy to use.   
That is, all you need to start using bmakelib is adding a single line somewhere in your Makefile:

```Makefile
include bmakelib/bmakelib.mk
```

## 3.1 Make `include` path

üí° *You can safely skip this section if you have installed bmakelib using the prepackaged artefacts or
you have installed it in a standard location (such as `/usr/local` or `/usr`.)*

In case you installed bmakelib in a non-standard location, you either need to `include` bmakelib using
full path or pass the installation directory to make via `--include-dir` option.

For example, assuming you installed bmakelib to `/my-collection/bmakelib`:

### Option #1

Makefile:

```Makefile
include bmakelib/bmakelib.mk

my-target :
    ...
```

Shell:

```
$ make --include-dir /my-collection/bmakelib my-target
```

### Option #2

Makefile:

```Makefile
include /my-collection/bmakelib/include/bmakelib.mk

my-target :
    ...
```

Shell:

```
$ make my-target
```
